1️⃣ Java's Approach to Async
In Java, asynchronous programming is usually done with:

Threads

ExecutorService

CompletableFuture (Java 8+)

Reactive frameworks (RxJava, Project Reactor)

Virtual Threads (Project Loom, Java 21+ — makes async look like sync)

2️⃣ CompletableFuture – Java’s Closest to async/await
CompletableFuture is an API for running tasks asynchronously and chaining them together.

Example
java
Copy
Edit
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;

public class AsyncAwaitJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
        
        CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            // Simulating async task
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            return "Hello from async task";
        });

        // "await" equivalent is .get() or .join()
        String result = future.get(); // Blocks until complete
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
Explanation:

supplyAsync() → starts a task asynchronously in another thread.

.get() → waits for the result (like await).

.join() → same as .get() but throws unchecked exceptions.

3️⃣ Chaining Async Calls (Java-style await)
java
Copy
Edit
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    return "Step 1";
}).thenApply(result -> {
    return result + " → Step 2";
}).thenApply(result -> {
    return result + " → Step 3";
});

System.out.println(future.join()); 
This is similar to:

javascript
Copy
Edit
let result = await step1();
result = step2(result);
result = step3(result);
4️⃣ Java 21+ (Project Loom) – True async/await feel
With virtual threads in Java 21, you can write blocking code without worrying about thread performance. It feels like async/await because the blocking call doesn’t hog system threads.

java
Copy
Edit
try (var executor = java.util.concurrent.Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    executor.submit(() -> {
        String result = fetchData(); // Looks sync, but runs in a virtual thread
        System.out.println(result);
    });
}
5️⃣ Summary
Java has no native async/await keywords yet (only similar patterns via CompletableFuture or Loom).

await-like behavior in Java = calling .get() / .join() on a CompletableFuture.

For real async/await style code, Project Loom (Java 21+) makes async code look synchronous without losing performance.
