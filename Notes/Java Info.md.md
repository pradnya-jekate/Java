Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent programming language. It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Now, it is owned by Oracle Corporation.



🔧 Key Features of Java:

Platform Independent – "Write Once, Run Anywhere" using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).



Object-Oriented – Uses classes and objects for code reusability and structure.



Robust – Strong memory management and exception handling.



Secure – Has a security manager and bytecode verifier.



Multithreaded – Supports concurrent execution using threads.



High Performance – Through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.



Portable – Can run on various hardware and operating systems without changes.



Distributed – Facilitates building distributed applications using RMI and EJB.



📦 Java Editions:

Java SE (Standard Edition) – Core functionality (desktop apps, server-side logic).



Java EE (Enterprise Edition) – Tools for large-scale web and enterprise apps. (Now Jakarta EE)



Java ME (Micro Edition) – For mobile and embedded systems.



JavaFX – For building rich GUI applications.



📁 Basic Java Program:

java

Copy

Edit

public class HelloWorld {

&nbsp;   public static void main(String\[] args) {

&nbsp;       System.out.println("Hello, World!");

&nbsp;   }

}

🧩 Core Concepts:

Classes and Objects



Inheritance



Polymorphism



Abstraction



Encapsulation



Interfaces



Exception Handling



Multithreading



Collections Framework



Streams and Lambda Expressions (Java 8+)



📚 Java Tools:

JDK (Java Development Kit) – Contains compiler, debugger, and tools.



JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – For running Java programs.



JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – Executes bytecode on any platform.



⚙️ Common Java Frameworks:

Spring/Spring Boot – For enterprise and web applications



Hibernate – ORM (Object Relational Mapping)



Maven/Gradle – Build and dependency management tools
